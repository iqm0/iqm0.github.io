Hello there!

I am new at development, but I have hopes of becoming a DevOps engineer at some point in the future. In the process of trying to learn some HTML and CSS, I made the decision of making/adapting a little business card with some social links.

I have found and downloaded a free to use template from HTML5 UP and started editing it, changed some of the icons (very easy to do with the integrated CSS file with the fontawesome icon library), background and logo. Most of it is pretty much the same, but the intention is to have something to play around with it as I gain more knowledge.

The template .zip was extracted here, then cloned to my local repository, changes were made using Virtual Studio Code (loving this application, very clean but full of features under the hood).
